/**
* CLASS: TaskHandler
* DATE: 07/04/17
* AUTHOR: Kyle Morris
* DESCRIPTION: Similar to arc_base, in that this node allows for toggling of tasks
* to complete.
* There are restrictions on what combinations of tasks can be done at the same time.
*
* The task handler is a client with respect to task servers it communicates with, however it is a server
* with respect to the Recruitment Manager
*
* For example, while multiple background tasks may be done together, you cannot do
* multiple non-background tasks at the same time.
