/**
* CLASS: CommunicationManager
* DATE: 21/03/17
* AUTHOR: Kyle Morris
* DESCRIPTION: Manages incoming and outgoing communication.
* After the wifi_handler processes incoming signals,
* they will be received by this node and further decomposed for the robot.
* The robot can also make broadcasts requests to this node
* with tasks or other messages which are then wrapped up as
* signals and broadcasted by the wifi_handler.
